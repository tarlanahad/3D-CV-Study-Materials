    "\n",
    "The normalization matrix $T$ is used to scale and translate a set of points so that their centroid is at the origin and their average distance from the origin is $\\sqrt{2}$, which enhances numerical stability for further calculations. The derivation of this matrix involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling**:\n",
    "   - To scale the points, we multiply each coordinate by a scaling factor $s$. For a point $(u, v)$, this is represented as $s \\cdot u$ and $s \\cdot v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Translation**:\n",
    "   - After scaling, the points are translated such that the centroid is at the origin. For the scaled point $(u', v')$ and the original mean $(\\bar{u}, \\bar{v})$, the translated coordinates are $u'' = u' - \\bar{u}$ and $v'' = v' - \\bar{v}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Operations**:\n",
    "   - The normalized coordinates $(u'', v'')$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "     $$ u'' = s \\cdot u - s \\cdot \\bar{u} $$\n",
    "     $$ v'' = s \\cdot v - s \\cdot \\bar{v} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Matrix Form**:\n",
    "   - We can express these operations in matrix form for homogeneous coordinates:\n",
    "     $$ \\begin{bmatrix} u'' \\\\ v'' \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s & 0 & -s \\cdot \\bar{u} \\\\ 0 & s & -s \\cdot \\bar{v} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deriving Scale Factor $s$**:\n",
    "   - The scale factor $s$ is determined by the condition that the average distance from the origin should be $\\sqrt{2}$. If $\\sigma$ is the average standard deviation from the centroid, then $s = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Final Matrix $T$**:\n",
    "   - The normalization matrix $T$ is thus defined as:\n",
    "     $$ T = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma} & 0 & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma} \\cdot \\bar{u} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sigma} \\cdot \\bar{v} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
